🛡️ Web Application Vulnerability Scanner
=========================================

This is a simple Python-based vulnerability scanner that detects common security issues in web forms like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (SQLi). It crawls a target website, locates all HTML forms, injects test payloads, and checks for reflections or vulnerable responses.

Key Features:
-------------
- 🔍 Automatically discovers forms on the target page
- 💉 Tests for:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
- 🧠 Uses basic payloads for proof-of-concept detection
- 🌐 Uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for HTTP and parsing
- 🚫 Gracefully handles connection and parsing errors

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.6+
- requests
- beautifulsoup4

Install Requirements:
---------------------
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

How to Use:
-----------
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the scanner script:

   python scanner.py

4. Input the target URL when prompted (e.g., http://testphp.vulnweb.com).

Sample Output:
--------------
[+] Found 2 forms on http://example.com

[>] Testing XSS on http://example.com/login.php
[!] XSS Vulnerability Found on http://example.com/login.php

[>] Testing SQLI on http://example.com/login.php
[-] No SQLI vulnerability on http://example.com/login.php
